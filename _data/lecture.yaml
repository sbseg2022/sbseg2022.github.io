      biography: "Frank Piessens is a full professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
                  Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. His research field is software and systems security.
                  He has worked both on attack techniques, as well as on defenses. On the defense side, he has contributed to
                  verification techniques for C-like languages, the enforcement of information flow security, countermeasure
                  for memory safety related vulnerabilities, and the design and implementation of embedded security architectures.
                  On the attack side, he has contributed to the discovery of several transient execution attacks, and to the
                  development
                  of exploitation techniques for memory safety vulnerabilities. Frank has served on the program committee of
                  numerous
                  security and software conferences including ACM CCS, Usenix Security, IEEE Security & Privacy, and ACM POPL.
                  He acted as program chair for the International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust (POST 2016),
                  for the IEEE European Symposium on Security & Privacy (Euro S&P 2018 & 2019), and for the IEEE Secure
                  Development
                  Conference (SecDev 2021 & 2022)."
    title: "Mitigating microarchitectural attacks by co-designing hardware and software countermeasures"
    abstract: "Microarchitectural attacks, including high-profile attacks like cache attacks and Spectre attacks,
            are a threat to many of the important computation platforms, such as, for instance, cloud platforms or
            browsers.
            A key challenge in mitigating these attacks is achieving strong security guarantees without giving up on the
            performance benefits that advanced microarchitectures offer. One promising approach to achieve good
            performance/security trade-offs is to co-design hardware and software countermeasures in a systematic way.
            This talk will provide an introduction to microarchitectural attacks, and to transient execution attacks
            like Spectre in particular, and will discuss how to provide efficient end-to-end security guarantees through
            hardware/software co-design of countermeasures."

        Research), and a Professor of Computer Science at New York University. Dr. Dodis received his summa cum laude
        Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University in 1996, and his PhD degree in
        Computer Science from MIT in 2000. Dr. Dodis was a post-doc at IBM T.J.Watson Research center in 2000, and

        He worked in a variety of areas, including random number generation, secure messaging, leakage-resilient
        cryptography, cryptography under weak randomness, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash
        function and block cipher design, protocol composition and information-theoretic cryptography In addition
        to being an IACR Fellow, Dr. Dodis is the recipient of 2021 and 2019 IACR Test-of-Time Awards for his work
        on Fuzzy Extractors and Verifiable Random Functions, National Scien Foundation CAREER Award, Faculty Awards

        Conference. 
        As an undergraduate student, he was also a winner of the US-Canada Putnam Mathematical Competition in 1995.
        Dr. Dodis has more than 150 scientific publications at various top venues, was the Program co-Chair for the 2022
        CRYPTO and 2015 Theory of Cryptography Conference, the editor of Journal of Cryptology (2012-2019), has been on
        program committees of many international conferences (including FOCS, STOC, CRYPTO and Eurocrypt), and gave
        numerous invited lectures and courses at various venues."
    title: "Random Number Generation and Extraction"
    abstract: "Generating random numbers is an essential task in cryptography. They are necessary not only for
        generating cryptographic keys, but are also needed in steps of cryptographic algorithms or protocols (e.g.
        initialization vectors for symmetric encryption, password generation, nonce generation). Indeed, the lack of
        insurance about the generated random numbers can cause serious damages in cryptographic protocols, and
        vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. In this talk we revisit a surprisingly rich landscape of
        the area of random number generation, ranging from theoretical impossibility results to building real-world
        random-number generators (RNGs) for Windows, Apple and Linux. Some example topics include impossibility of
        basing cryptography on entropy alone, improved key derivation functions, seedless randomness extraction, design
        and analysis of \"super-fast\" entropy accumulation found in most modern RNGs, and post-compromise security of
                RNGs in light of \"premature next\" attacks."

    title: "YOU ONLY SPEAK ONCE: Private Computing On Public Blockchains"
    abstract: "Blockchains are well-known for their consensus and integrity properties but secrecy
        is hard to enforce, let alone general secure privacy-preserving computation. In this talk I will introduce a
        notion called \"You Only Speak Once\" (YOSO) and show how it leads to scalable secure (multi-party) computation
        over blockchains. In the YOSO model of computation, a small subset of parties (physical machines) are
        periodically
        assigned ephemeral roles that require the machine to send a single message after which the machine erases all
        its state. Thus, an attacker, that is limited on the number of machines it can control at any given time, cannot
        know which machines/roles to attack till they speak; but then it is too late to learn useful information from
        their compromise. This model can be realized in blockchains where it is unpredictable who the proposer of the
        next block is, such as in bitcoin, Algorand and others."

    title: "The Business of Proof"
    abstract: "With only a few niche applications, the software industry had not previously figured out how to make deep use of formal mechanical reasoning based on mathematical logic. At Amazon we hab ve recently seen tremendous adoption of the approach by product groups, with a variety of customer-facing launches that use automated reasoning, and numerous internal proof projects.  This describes those projects, and captures aspects of why Amazon has been successful where others have been less so.  The talk also describes challenges that we face to scale the approach to the next level."
