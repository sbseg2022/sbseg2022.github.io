    Abstract:
    Microarchitectural attacks, including high-profile attacks like cache attacks and Spectre attacks, are a threat to many of the important computation platforms, such as, for instance, cloud platforms or browsers.
    A key challenge in mitigating these attacks is achieving strong security guarantees without giving up on the performance benefits that advanced microarchitectures offer.
    One promising approach to achieve good performance/security trade-offs is to co-design hardware and software countermeasures in a systematic way.
    This talk will provide an introduction to microarchitectural attacks, and to transient execution attacks like Spectre in particular, and will discuss how to provide efficient end-to-end security guarantees through hardware/software co-design of countermeasures.

    Bio:
    Frank Piessens is a full professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
    Belgium.
    His research field is software and systems security.
    He has worked both on attack techniques, as well as on defenses.
    On the defense side, he has contributed to verification techniques for C-like languages, the enforcement of
    information flow security, countermeasures for memory safety related vulnerabilities, and the design and
    implementation of embedded security architectures.
    On the attack side, he has contributed to the discovery of several transient execution attacks, and to the
    development of exploitation techniques for memory safety vulnerabilities.
    Frank has served on the program committee of numerous security and software conferences including ACM CCS, Usenix
    Security, IEEE Security & Privacy, and ACM POPL.
    He acted as program chair for the International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust (POST 2016), for the
    IEEE European Symposium on Security & Privacy (Euro S&P 2018 & 2019), and for the IEEE Secure Development Conference
    (SecDev 2021 & 2022).
