<p>The Brazilian Symposium on Information and Computational Systems Security (SBSeg) is a scientific event promoted
    annually by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) under the responsibility of the Special Committee on Information
    and Computational Systems Security (CESeg) of SBC. It represents the countryâ€™s main forum for disseminating research
    results, debates, exchange of ideas and relevant activities related to information and computational systems
    security, aiming to integrate the Brazilian community of researchers and professionals working in this area.</p>

<p>In 2022, the XXII SBSeg will happen from September 12-15, 2022 organized by the Federal University of Santa Maria
    (UFSM). We are very happy to welcome you all in Santa Maria and are confident that the situation is improving
    regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, in view of the possible travel restrictions, the conference
    will be in the form of a hybrid conference with as many authors and participants as possible attending the
    conference in Santa Maria in person, and others attending remotely. The technical program will include physical
    sessions with on-site presentations and virtual (on-line) sessions for remote participants. SBSeg22 will be a unique
    opportunity for participants to enjoy the cultural activities of the largest city in Brazil and the technical
    sessions, short courses, workshops and keynotes given by internationally renowned guests. It is worth mentioning
    that in this edition the II Capture the Flag (CtF) will occur.</p>
