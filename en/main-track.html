        The Main Track of the Brazilian Symposium on Information and Computational Systems
        Security (SBSeg) is the primary means of disseminating of research in the
        security area within the event. Through it, the community can share its experiences
        and research results by submitting articles describing solutions that advance
        state-of-the-art themes of interest to the event. It involves:

        <h2 id="autores">Instructions to Authors</h2>

        <p>
            SBSeg 2022 has <u><b> two main tracks</b></u>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Security of Computer Systems and Communication Networks</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cryptography</b></li>
        </ul>

        In each track, there are two types of possible submissions:
        <b> full papers and short papers. </b>
        Authors will have to indicate in the submission which track their
        work best fits and whether it is a complete or short paper.

        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b> Full Papers (up to 14 pages): </b>
                <br> A full paper must present a research paper developed to the
                point of bringing original and relevant results, duly validated
                and discussed. The presentation of the article must contain a
                detailed and reasoned description of the research work and consistent conclusions based on the
                results obtained. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b> Short papers (up to 6 pages): </b>
                <br> Submissions in this category should present preliminary ongoing
                research results related to any topic of interest to the SBSeg.
                This category <u> will also accept articles the from industry </u> that
                present innovative solutions for security system architectures or reports
                of new experiences on the application of technological innovations in information
                security. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Papers can be written in Portuguese or English; the format must follow the SBC
            model for publishing articles, available on
            <a href="http://www.sbc.org.br/documentos-da-sbc/category/169-templates-para-artigos-e-capitulos-de-livros" target="_blank">
                the SBC portal</a>. The page limits for full and short
            papers must be strictly followed (under penalty of being returned without
            evaluation) and already include title, figures, tables, references,
            and appendices. The submission of papers will be made exclusively in
            PDF format through the
            <a href="https://jems.sbc.org.br/home.cgi?c=4078" target="_blank">SBC's JEMS</a> system.
        </p>

        <p>
            Papers must be submitted anonymously, i.e., authors should omit any information in the
            article's header, in the text, and in the references that link the article to the authors'
            reviewers, and their institutions.
            We recommend reading the
            <a href="http://horizontes.sbc.org.br/index.php/2021/01/guia-rapido-para-submissao-anonima:-proteja-sua-identidade-corretamente/" target="_blank">
                Anonymous Submission Quick Guide
            </a> from SBC's Horizontes magazine.
        </p>

        <p>
            All papers will be evaluated by a body of reviewers, following a double blind review
            process (without identification of authors, reviewers and their institutions).
            To be published in the annals, accepted papers must be
            presented at the event by one of the authors, who must be formally
            registered. The full papers will be presented in technical sessions,
            and short papers will be presented as posters. One evaluation committee
            will choose the best among the papers presented at the event
        </p>

        <p>
            Authors of accepted articles will have to sign a Term of Assignment of Copyrights
            (copyright) to the Brazilian Computer Society to make the publication
            feasible. Submission of articles already submitted and/or published
            in other events or scientific journals is not acceptable.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> Important Recommendations: </b> We recommended that authors review
            previous SBSeg publications to see if and how work has been developed
            in the same field by authors in our community. Besides, we suggest
            that authors consider the appropriateness of including references to related
            works published in previous editions of SBSeg (on the event websites
            or at the
            <a href="https://www.ceseg.org/anais-trilha-principal" target="_blank">
                CESeg web page</a>), aiming to honor and value the work of our security community.
