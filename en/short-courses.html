<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>
    The SBSeg Short Courses aim to address relevant topics that are generally not taught in the curricula of
    undergraduate courses, in addition to arousing interest in the area of security among academics and professionals,
    which may be of a practical or theoretical nature. Priority is given to current issues with the greatest potential
    to attract the interest of young students and professionals, in order to better qualify them for their research
    and/or job market. Each mini-course must be structured for a total of three hours of online presentation.

<h3>Instructions to Authors</h3>

<p>Professors/researchers interested in teaching a short course must submit a proposal, written in Portuguese,
    containing between 3 and 5 pages (excluding CVs, item 6 below), with the following information::
<ol>
    <li>Identification data - Title of the short course, authors, institution(s) and indication of the author who will
        present the course;
    </li>
    <li>General data - Course objectives, treatment of the topic (for example: theoretical or practical; general results
        or in-depth analysis of specific aspects; presentation or comparison of technologies; formation of new skills or
        information, etc.) and desired profile of the audience;
    </li>
    <li>Expected text structure (topics/chapters to be developed);</li>
    <li>For each chapter/topic provided for in item 3, write a summary of its content and a forecast of the respective
        number of pages;
    </li>
    <li>Main bibliography used in the preparation of the course;</li>
    <li>Authors' summarized curriculum vitae (maximum one page per author).</li>
</ol>

<p>All the information above must be contained in only one document (a file in PDF format) to be submitted exclusively
    through the system SBC JEMS . The following criteria will be considered in the evaluation: relevance and topicality
    of the theme for the event, technical quality of the proposal and experience of the proponents in the proposed
    theme. The best proposals on different topics will be accepted for presentation and publication. In order to ensure
    the diversity of the short courses offered, the selected proposals will deal with different themes.</p>

<p>The authors of the selected proposals must produce a text (book chapter) in Portuguese containing between 40 and 50
    pages. The texts will be published, in the form of chapters, in the book "Minicursos SBSeg 2021". The model for
    publishing the book chapter is <a href="https://www.sbc.org.br">available on the SBC portal</a>. It's important to
    check if the topic of your proposal has not already been published in the previous editions of the event (<a
            href="https://www.ceseg.org/mini-cursos">https://www.ceseg.org/mini-cursos</a>), in this case your
    publication will not be accepted.</p>

<p>SBSeg 2022 will take place in the hybrid format (semipresencial), therefore, the presentations of the short courses
    accepted will occur locally or remotely. All short course articles accepted should be presented in a structured
    format for a total of three hours by at least 1 co-author of the article.</p>
